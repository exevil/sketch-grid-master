# Sketch Grid Toggler
Grid Toggler is a tiny Sketch plugin that fixes the long standing bug with switching grid and layout visibility for multiple artboards.

## Installation
Since grid or layout visibility toggling are the most common functions in design workflow I used regular CTRL+G & CTRL+L shortcuts in the plugin. To make it work as expected you should assign any different shortcut to Sketch's default Show Grid and Show Layout functions. Here're 4 easy steps how to do it:

1. [Download](https://github.com/exevil/sketch-grid-toggler/archive/master.zip) and install Sketch Grid Toggler as any usual plugin by click on it;
2. Open  → System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts and hit the + button;
3. Choose Sketch.app as Application, enter "Show Grid" as Menu Title and assign CTRL+ALT+G as Keyboard Shortcut;
4. Repeat step 3 with "Show Layout" as Menu Title and CTRL+ALT+L as Keyboard Shortcut.

Voila! Now you can use familiar shortcuts with new functionality.

## Upcoming updates
