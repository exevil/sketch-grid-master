# Sketch Grid Master
Grid Master is a Sketch plugin that fixes long-standing bugs and adds new functionaity related on work with Grid and Layout.

## Features
**Toggle Grid/Layout** — fixes the long-standing bug with toggling grid and layout visibility for multiple artboards. Please check the [installation guide](https://github.com/exevil/sketch-grid-master#installation) to make it work as expected.

## Installation

Since grid or layout visibility toggling are the most common functions in design workflow I used regular `CTRL + G` & `CTRL + L` shortcuts for these plugin commands. To make it work as expected you should assign any different shortcut to Sketch's default Show Grid and Show Layout functions. Here're 4 easy steps how to do it:

1. [Download](https://github.com/exevil/sketch-grid-master/archive/master.zip) and install Sketch Grid Master as any usual plugin by click on it;
2. Open  → System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts and hit the + button;
3. Choose Sketch.app as Application, enter "Show Grid" as Menu Title and assign `CTRL+ALT+G` as Keyboard Shortcut;
4. Repeat step 3 with "Show Layout" as Menu Title and `CTRL+ALT+L` as Keyboard Shortcut.

Voila! Now you can use familiar shortcuts with new functionality.
